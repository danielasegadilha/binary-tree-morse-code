# 🌳 Binary Tree - Morse Code
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-success)

## 📚 Overview

This Python program uses a binary tree to encode and decode messages in Morse code. The binary tree structure is designed to efficiently map characters to their Morse code representations.

## 🚀 Usage

Make sure you have Python installed in your environment. Run the main program `main.py` and follow the instructions to input a message in text or Morse code.

### Examples

1. **Encode Message:**
   ```bash
   Enter a message to convert into Morse Code: (e.g. SOS)
Enter a message, e.g., "SOS," and get the output in Morse code.

2. **Decode Morse Code:**
   ```bash
   Enter a morse code:
Enter Morse code, e.g., "... --- ...," and get the decoded message.

## 📚 Libraries Used
The program uses a library to draw the binary tree on the console.

### Tree Drawing Library
The source code for the tree drawing library is in tree.py. This library is based on drawtree and is licensed under MIT.
